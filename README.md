# Image Recognition (Classification) Using CNN
Image recognition refers to the task of inputting an image into a neural network and
having it output some kind of label for that image. The label that the network outputs
will correspond to a pre-defined class. There can be multiple classes that the image can
be labeled as, or just one. If there is a single class, the term "recognition" is often
applied, whereas a multi-class recognition task is often called "classification".
A subset of image classification is object detection, where specific instances of objects are
identified as belonging to a certain class like animals, cars, or people.
